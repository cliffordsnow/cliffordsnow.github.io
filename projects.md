Projects

## King County Import
King County Washington address import process was started in December 2013. The [import wiki](wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/King_County_Import) is complete. The process is being driven by the [OpenStreetMap US Tasking Manager](tasks.openstreetmap.us). Minor edits are needed to satisfy the import community before the project is ready for implementation.

## Seattle Duplicate Address Cleanup

## Future Work Group
