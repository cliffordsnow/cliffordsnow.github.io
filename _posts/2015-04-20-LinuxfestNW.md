Recently I posted a request for help with my OSM presentation at the [Linuxfest Northwest](http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/2015) in Bellingham. Here is what I learned.

### What do you enjoy most about OpenStreetMap?
Ian McWen "I love most being able to do things and add things at broader or more
specific scales and see the fruits of my work almost immediately -- both
the breadth of possible participation and the quick feedback loop."
  
### What about OSM surprised you most?
Richard Weait "The amazing diversity in the interests of new contributors.  I meet
new OpenStreetMap contributors every month, and the interest that
brings them in to meet us differ widely."

Ian McEwen "This is nerdy, but I guess you're talking to a linuxfest audience
anyway: the data model. My Day Job (TM) is working on another open-data
project (MusicBrainz, if you're curious) and I was impressed and
surprised how much OSM does with three basic objects that contain each
other, free-text key-value fields, and a single derivation step (from
raw data to a map, or to a route, or to whatever else)."<br>

### What do you tell people when they ask you why you map?
Ian McEwen "Because I use it! OSM is my go-to map for seeing things anywhere in the
real world, from OsmAnd and its offline maps on my phone, to looking up
addresses with the search/Nominatim, to figuring out routes with OsmAnd
or manually, to the very specific task of figuring out ranges for
portals for playing Google's augmented-reality game Ingress.
Secondarily, though, the reason I use it is because I believe in the
value of open data both to serve needs that corporate establishments
cannot or will not and to ensure growth and provider-independence."

Mike Thompson "Mapping in OSM is a form of free expression (really a broad form of free speech), just like blogging, editing a Wikipedia article, or creating a video.  In the past editors a publishers decided what got mapped, now - with OpenStreetMap - we can decide."
### What is should I absolutely not leave out of the presentation? 
Richard Weait <br>1. "Go outside and survey your neighbourhood. There is nothing better
that you can do for OpenStreetMap, than behave as though you are
tending a shared garden."
<br>2. Time for questions.  I have trouble with this because I like to talk. :-)
<br>3. "It's Fun. It's Free. You can help."  One of the earliest tag lines
used in the project.  True then. true now.

Ian McEwen "I doubt you would leave this out, but a call to action and a bit of a
demonstration: as I mention, I really love the quick feedback loop of
editing OSM, and I think an in-presentation "open
iD/potlatch/josm/whatever, make changes, go to the page and see, look!
it's there now!" would be the best way to demonstrate exactly how nice
that is, and obviously also asking people to do the same for the parts
of the world they know and frequent is the whole goal!"

Mike Thompson  "The *big problem* that OSM solves. For a Linux audience this shouldn't be difficult, but I would still state that most other map sources are not truly "free" - and say a little bit about why that is a problem.  "
