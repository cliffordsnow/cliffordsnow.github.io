Martijn van Exel's [Missing Roads](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/mvexel/diary/35966) JOSM
plugin uses gps tracks to identify missing roads in OpenStreetMap. Some of the tracks are from
trucks working in farm fields. Others are from missing service roads. And some are new construction.
If the construction is recent, the TIGER missing roads layer doesn't help. I've found looking at
the Counties road centerline data the best way to not only accurately add the new way but also give it the right name. 

I set about creating a table with all 39 Washington State counties with the counties gis website and
if there was gis data available. A typical duckduckgo.com search was *skagit county wa gis*. I noted
if there was any GIS information available. For Whatcom County, I knew that the City of Bellingham 
had most of the counties data.

Graphically this is the results of my inquiry.
