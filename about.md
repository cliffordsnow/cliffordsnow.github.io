Clifford Snow is a volunteer contributor to OpenStreetMap based in Washington State. Living in a small town just north of Seattle, Clifford has discovered the fun of mapping rural America. Most mappers live in map in large urban areas. Rural mapping is different and not just because you need to travel many miles to find the next POI, but because there isn't another mapper near by to discuss mapping at a local coffee shop.


His interest in building community partically stem from his time creating glass art as part of a glass blowing team. He believes creating great art requires great teams.

Clifford lead a team that held OpenStreetMap's 10th Anniversary celebration in Seattle. The event included talks on mapping, georectification and a demo of aerial photography from a kit. He also was an organizer for the 2016 State of the Map US held in Seattle.
